This is a personal website for Shaun Burdick.
The website is meant to look and behave like an old computer console, similar to a VT terminal.
There is humor and easter eggs through out the application.

The website is written in React using Typescript.
It uses ESLint and Jest for linting and testing.

Keep the code modern, using the latest tools and libraries but as simple as possible.
Avoid including new libraries when possible.

The deployment is done using Docker and Github Pages via a deploy workflow.

The website must be WCAG 2 compliant for accessibility and is tested for use by screen readers.
Try not to use classes or complex CSS, the idea is to style the elements directly.

Do not output anything to the console unless directed.
All imports and lists should be sorted alphabetically unless functionality requires it.
Do not leave any trailing spaces, but add a new line to the end of a file.
Add TSDoc comments to every method and function.
